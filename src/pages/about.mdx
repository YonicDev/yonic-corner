I am a Spanish game developer, and I welcome you to my (not so) personal space.

Of course, I love videogames, but I also have a thing for cartoons, science stuff and astronomy, 
as well as a huge curiosity for Japan and its culture.

## About this blog

I plan to write about wild thoughts in my head, my experiences, and
programming and UX/game design tips. Maybe it'll be a bit hard to find your
way through the site, so I made multiple ways of surfing my site:

* **Categories:** Pretty much what it says on the tin. Every article belongs to just one.
* **Tags:** Very useful for specific searches. Most articles have more than one tag.
* **Series:** Think of it as a blog version of a music or video playlist:
An ordered list of articles talking about the same topic, split into
multiple parts.

The design is meant to give you a throwback to the old web, back when it started
in the 1990s, but maintaining the design standards and taking advantage of
the modern web, so it has many things from tons of (vectorized) decoration from
the pixel age of the web, including custom mouse cursors, to marquees: Yeah, *marquees*.
At this point I could throw in a flying animated GIF somewhere
&mdash; or rather, the modern equivalent, WebP &mdash; for the finishing touch.

Sadly, because it uses modern web technology, it's not compatible with Internet Explorer.
But at least **you don't need JavaScript to read this blog**!
While I plan to add a couple of enhancements with JavaScript,
I've worked very hard to make this site as script-free as possible, so feel free
to disable JavaScript here if you care about bloat and privacy.

## About this blog's characters

A common signature feature of many old-school blogs, especially Japanese ones,
is to have some characters wandering about the site, giving the place a lot of personality.

In here, these characters take form of vector sprites that can show multiple expressions and emotions.
Since they're vector images, they show up at any display scale while keeping the maximum visual quality,
no matter how big they are and how much you zoom in.

By the way, if you put your cursor over the characters on your PC, or hold your finger on them while on mobile,
you can see what they're thinking about!

**Yonic** is the main character of this site, and one of my oldest characters I've ever came up with.
He has had many redesigns over the years, but at its core, he hasn't changed much,
which goes to show how fond I am of this character.

<TextBubble position="bottom" alignment="far" theme="yonic">
    My current design is relatively new, so you might see me in my previous design’s sprites, 
    but they’ll get replaced with the ones with this design over time.
</TextBubble>
<Chara name="yonic" set="summer" sprite="normal" thoughts="Yonic is happy to see you!" />

Right now you'll only see Yonic wandering about, but very likely you'll see more in the future.
